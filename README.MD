# Dappy propositions

### Abstract

XXIst century will see the digitization of human activities continue to extend, as well as the rise of new decentralized, or shared online governance structures.

The public web has always been in need for security, many researchers and developers would agree that browser behaviors, web standards do not match with the criticalness of some online services. Permissive cookie management by browsers as well as the DNS protocol and structure are examples.

Dappy is the first public name system and PKI system in the world that in addition to living on the blockchain, allows fully encrypted co-resolution at the browser level (secure trustless service discovery is another way to phrase it), thus **raising the security and accuracy levels by few orders of magnitudes for service discovery by browsers and other arbitrary programs**.

In the same process of seeking for disruptive or superior security designs we propose 3 additionals changes mainly about cookies, and Content-Security-Policy handling. The 4 propositions are written in an agnostic fashion although they serve as a base for development in the dappy project. We highly encourage researchers, and developers to raise issue, criticize, or comment those propositions any way they want.
